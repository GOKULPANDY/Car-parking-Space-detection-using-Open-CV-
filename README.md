Our project is about detecting the free available parking space with help of CCTV camera using Machine Learning.



# DetectParking

Algorithm for parking detection using computer vision with OPENCV.

This work was based on the work of https://github.com/eladj/detectParking 


Eladj thanks for your algorithm. You helped a lot.

We use Python 2.7 with OpenCv to work on it.

The YAML library was used.

To install use: 

pip install pyyaml

The main code is in python/main.py

You can place parking limits on datasets/parking2.yml
